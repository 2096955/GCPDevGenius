# Product Requirements Document: AWS to GCP Full Replacement (Full Vibe Coded, A2A & MCP Enhanced)

## 1. Overview
This document specifies the requirements for a complete re-implementation of the DevGenius solution, replacing all AWS components with native Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services. The new solution will be designed and built from the ground up for GCP, leveraging Vertex AI and other GCP-native offerings. The process will be fully automated and AI-driven (“full vibe coded”), and will leverage both A2A (Agent2Agent protocol) and MCP (Model Context Protocol) for maximum modularity, extensibility, and automation.

## 2. Target Architecture Components (GCP-Native)
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Google Cloud Deployment Manager or Terraform
- **Serverless Compute:** Google Cloud Functions (replacing AWS Lambda)
- **Container Orchestration:** Google Cloud Run (replacing ECS Fargate)
- **AI/ML:** Google Vertex AI (replacing Amazon Bedrock)
- **Vector Search:** Vertex AI Search (replacing OpenSearch Serverless)
- **Database:** Cloud Firestore or Cloud Spanner (replacing DynamoDB)
- **Object Storage:** Google Cloud Storage (replacing S3)
- **Networking:** Google VPC, Cloud Load Balancing, Cloud CDN, Cloud Armor (replacing VPC, CloudFront, etc.)
- **Authentication:** Firebase Authentication/Google Identity Platform (replacing Cognito)
- **Secrets Management:** Secret Manager (replacing AWS Secrets Manager)
- **Configuration:** Secret Manager, Config Connector, or Parameter Store equivalents
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Cloud Monitoring, Logging, Trace

## 3. Protocol-Driven Automation: A2A & MCP
- **A2A (Agent2Agent Protocol):**
  - Used for agent-to-agent collaboration, delegation, and coordination.
  - Enables specialized agents (e.g., code conversion, data migration, security validation) to communicate, share tasks, and parallelize work.
  - Supports dynamic discovery of new agent capabilities via Agent Cards.
  - Example: A code analysis agent delegates schema conversion to a database agent, and security validation to a compliance agent, all via A2A.
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol):**
  - Used for agent-to-tool/API integration.
  - Standardizes how agents invoke tools, APIs, and external resources (e.g., Terraform, gcloud, test runners, documentation generators).
  - Ensures structured, reliable, and extensible tool usage.
  - Example: An agent calls "provision_gcp_resource" or "run_unit_tests" as MCP tools.

## 4. Replacement Phases & Logical Flow (Agent-Driven, Untimed, Protocol Enhanced)
- **Phase 1: Requirements Analysis & GCP Design**
  - The agent analyzes all existing AWS-based features and workflows (MCP: code analysis tools).
  - The agent designs an equivalent, GCP-native architecture (A2A: may delegate design review to architecture agent).
  - Service mappings and data models are defined programmatically (A2A: collaborate with data modeling agent).
- **Phase 2: Infrastructure Provisioning**
  - The agent provisions all required GCP resources using IaC (MCP: Terraform/gcloud tools).
  - Networking, security, and monitoring are set up automatically (A2A: may coordinate with security agent).
- **Phase 3: Application Rebuild**
  - The agent re-implements all application logic for GCP (A2A: code generation agent, code review agent).
  - Vertex AI is used for all AI/ML features (MCP: Vertex AI API tools).
  - APIs, endpoints, and workflows are updated for GCP compatibility (A2A: API design agent).
- **Phase 4: Data Model & Storage Setup**
  - The agent defines and creates new data models in Firestore/Spanner (A2A: data modeling agent, MCP: database provisioning tools).
  - Object storage is set up in Google Cloud Storage (MCP: storage provisioning tools).
- **Phase 5: Testing & Validation**
  - The agent generates and executes automated test suites for all new GCP-native components (MCP: test runner tools, A2A: test orchestration agent).
  - Performance, integration, and security testing are performed autonomously (A2A: security agent, performance agent).
- **Phase 6: Production Launch**
  - The agent deploys the solution to the production GCP environment (MCP: deployment tools).
  - Automated health checks and monitoring are enabled (MCP: monitoring tools).
  - Rollback automation is in place if needed (A2A: rollback agent).

**Note:**
All phases are executed by the agent without human intervention. Progression is determined by successful completion of each phase, not by elapsed time. A2A is used for agent collaboration and delegation; MCP is used for tool and API integration.

## 5. Resource Requirements (Automated)
- All requirements fulfilled by the AI Agent (full vibe coded)
- Automated design, code generation, testing, documentation, security, performance, error handling, monitoring
- Required tools: GCP API, Terraform, source repo, CI/CD, monitoring, security scanning (all exposed as MCP tools)
- Specialized agents for code, data, security, testing, and documentation (all discoverable and orchestrated via A2A)

## 6. Automation Workflows
- Automated requirements analysis and GCP design (A2A + MCP)
- Automated infrastructure provisioning and application build (MCP)
- Automated testing, deployment, and monitoring (A2A + MCP)
- No manual intervention required

## 7. Testing Requirements
- Automated unit, integration, performance, security, and load testing (MCP tools, orchestrated by A2A agents)
- 100% automated test coverage
- Automated rollback and recovery (A2A rollback agent)

## 8. Success Criteria
- All AWS components fully replaced with GCP-native services
- Solution runs entirely on GCP (Vertex AI, Cloud Run, etc.)
- Automated testing and validation
- Zero manual intervention
- Automated documentation and reporting
- Modular, extensible, and agentic architecture using A2A and MCP

## 9. Risk Mitigation
- Automated backup and rollback (A2A rollback agent, MCP backup tools)
- Real-time health and security monitoring (MCP monitoring tools, A2A security agent)
- Continuous validation and compliance (A2A compliance agent)

## 10. Best Practices for A2A & MCP
- Use MCP for all tool, API, and resource integrations.
- Use A2A for agent-to-agent collaboration, delegation, and parallelization.
- Design agents to advertise their capabilities via Agent Cards (A2A) and expose tools via MCP.
- Ensure all tools and agents are discoverable, composable, and replaceable.
- Monitor and log all agent and tool interactions for traceability and compliance.
